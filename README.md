The bacon blog assignment for UI Design

Here is a list of the requirements for the assignment:

1. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXWhen you visit http://localhost:8080/baconblog, 
	you will land on a home page with the most recent blog posts.
	The posts should be in sorted order by their date of creation 
	(newest post at the top of the page).  This home page
	shall be referred to as the “post list” page in the 
	requirements that follow. 

2. XXXXXXXXXXXXXEach post should have a title, the user ID who created 
	the post, the date the post was created, any tags the post 
	has, and the post content itself. 

3. XXXXXXXXXXXXXThe post list page should have a search box.  Once 
	the user uses the search box, the post list page should 
	display any posts whose content matches the search query.  This 
	includes all matches to post content, post tags, or post user ID.  

4. Anywhere a user ID appears, the user ID should be a 
	link to a user profile page. 

5. The user profile page should include all information in 
	the Profile class.  Any email addresses or Web URL’s should 
	be working links. 

6. The user profile page should show a default “anonymous” photo 
	(much like Facebook blue silhouette or the Twitter “egg” 
	avatar).  For now, we will only display a default photo.  
	Eventually (not part of this assignment), we will add the 
	ability to upload and display photos. 

7. Anywhere a tag appears (either on the user profile page or 
	on the post list page), the tag should be a link that filters 
	the post list page such that the page will only show posts 
	with that tag.  Also, the page should provide some form 
	of appropriate feedback that the posts are being filtered 
	using that particular tag. 

8. Only one tag may be used to filter the posts at a time. 

9. All pages must have the same look-and-feel (e.g., common 
	header/footer/colors, etc.). 

10. All pages must look professionally done. The quality 
	should be consistent with an application you would be 
	willing to show a potential employer as an example of your 
	typical work.
